# Status Monitor

This is a very simple status monitoring application for web applications and websites which I am building to re-visit the concepts of .NET platform, C# and ASP.NET Core framework.
The goal is to combine status monitoring and incident management, while building features incrementally. 

I am moving fast without hopefully breaking things, and so far documentation does not include instructions on how to set it up or anything of the like. 
I'm also using familiar technologies and packages on the front-end to build a UI that looks good and cohesive. Right now I am not concerning myself too much on the
structure or design of the app. I will revisit those concerns later.

Right now this app only contains authentication, ability to add monitoring targets using HTTP with different intervals, 
recording and displaying request statuses and response times. I have a Trello board set up for functionality that I want to build here, but I am adding them when I have time to work on it.

There are plenty of other open source status monitoring apps out there where I've taken some inspiration from, although this idea started from an introduction to Encore.
