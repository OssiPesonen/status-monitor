# Status Monitor

This is a very simple status monitoring application for web applications and websites.
The goal is to combine status monitoring and incident management, while building features incrementally,
as I re-visit the .NET platform with C# and ASP.NET Core framework.

So far this app simply contains authentication, ability to add monitoring targets using HTTP with different intervals, 
recording and displaying request statuses and response times.
